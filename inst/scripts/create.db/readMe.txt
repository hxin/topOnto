This script is used to generate topOnto.xxxxx.db package.

Note:You should have perl installed and perl packages "DBI" and "DBD::SQLite" are required, and 
you also need to have R installed and R package "RSQLite" is required.

There are two ways of doing it:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Use the script ./run.sh
	* Edit the config.txt
	* $sh ./run.sh
This will create the package and install it in R.

----------------------OR-------------------------------------------
2) Manually create the package from source
	*untar the file ./topOnto.skeleton.db.tar.gz and follow the readMe in the package root
